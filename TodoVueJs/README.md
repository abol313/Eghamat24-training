## Todo
It is a bit similar to [another project](https://github.com/abol313/Ighamat24-training/tree/master/todo_react_js) in React, but the time spent is more on it and it has many more features such as dead and banned todos... and some less...

## Vue
The framework of Js that i used is Vue
## My [@abol313](https://github.com/abol313), sec2nd project from Vue ;)
